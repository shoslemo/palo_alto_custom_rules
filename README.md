Script for converting Suricata signatures to Palo Alto XML.


Trying to create a script for converting Suricata voulnerabilities into Palo Alto signatures. 
When Palo ALto makes it nearly impossible to get licenses for their products, this is the only way one can actually utilize the firewalls full capabilities. 

The script currently works, but you have to manually upload every single signature to the target firewall as I have not (yet) been able to get the API to accept uploads of custom signatures. 

Please improve on, rewrite and use this as you want, and please share your improvements and tweaks.
